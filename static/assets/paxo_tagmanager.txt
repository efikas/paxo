P.S: There is a react-gtag bundler I once saw but can't remember it's name.
Please, hope you're not bundling it before wednesday, I am still working on a DataLayer you will add at the same time [to the site]. Hope that won't be inconvenient. 
P.P.S: We will meet again for the dataLayer variables once I see the final work and speak with GM on other deliverables.
